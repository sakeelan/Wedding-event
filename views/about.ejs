            <h5>ALBUM EDITING </h5>
<p>How do you make good album art? To create album art that turns heads, use font, colors and imagery that reflect your music and brand identity. Choose a font that is readable and doesn't vanish into a busy background. Aim for minimalism but keep it unique.</p>

                <h5>BANNER SETUP</h5>
<p>A happy marriage is the union of two good forgivers.” “The best time to love with your whole heart is always now, in this moment, because no breath beyond the current is promised.” “To find someone who will love you for no reason, and to shower that person with reasons, that is the ultimate happiness.”</p>

                    <h5>INVITATION CARDS</h5>
<p>Be sincere. A card is a great place to tell someone how much you really care about them and how much they mean to you. Thank the person - for the times they were there for you, helping you out, something nice they did for you or the unique qualities they bring to your life. Share a funny memory or story with them.</p>

                        <h5>DJ BASS SOUNDS</h5>
<p>I love music - in my playing days, I was always the team DJ. ...
    For me, it's a great thing to tell people anything is possible. ...
    As an individual I was known as the DJ or the mixer. ...
    When you DJ, you're just on your own, which is nice because there's no argument.</p>
